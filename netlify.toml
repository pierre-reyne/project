## Netlify configuration
##
## This project currently sets `homepage` in `package.json` for GitHub Pages
## (served from `/project`). Netlify typically serves from the domain root (`/`).
## We override Create React App's `PUBLIC_URL` during Netlify builds so assets are
## generated with root-relative URLs without changing the GitHub Pages config.

[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "build"

[build.environment]
  PUBLIC_URL = "/"
  # CRA v4 (react-scripts 4 / webpack 4) is not compatible with newer Node
  # versions (17+ / OpenSSL 3). Pin Node to a compatible version on Netlify.
  NODE_VERSION = "16"
